# WhatsApp message automater

**Automatically send one or more whatsapp messages without having to send them individually and without having the keep clicking on send.**

*The program uses pywhatkit, pyautogui, pynput and pandas

## Features

1. Instantly send a Whatsapp message to one or more Contacts
2. Schedule a Whatsapp message to one or more Contacts
3. Automater sends also clicks on the whatsapp web send button. No manual intervention is required by the user

## Constraints
1. Currently the program supports only .xlsx file format where you can store the contact numbers, contact name and the message to be delivered. I am working on to add .csv support
2. You'll need to open the whatsapp web once and ensure you are not logged out when the program set to run
